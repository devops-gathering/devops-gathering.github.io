      <description>Everybody&amp;rsquo;s hyped about Serverless, but what is it exactly about and what does it mean to develop a real application with it? Instead of just writing a simple &amp;ldquo;hello world function&amp;rdquo; in this workshop, we&amp;rsquo;re going to create a real weather application using different AWS buildings blocks. While building a scalable and cheap weather application, we&amp;rsquo;ll also look into the tricks and challenges of Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, XRay and Cloudwatch. At the end of this workshop, you&amp;rsquo;ll have the tools and skills to develop your own Serverless app.</description>

      <guid>https://devops-gathering.io/workshops/ansible-testing-with-molecule/</guid>
      <description>This workshop gives an introduction on test-driven development of ansible roles with molecule ( https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/stable )
Molecule provides support for testing with multiple instances, operating systems and distributions, virtualization providers, test frameworks and testing scenarios.
This workshop is hands-on and is designed for molecule beginner, basic ansible knowledge about playbook and role development is required.
Small parts will be implemented in Python, but should be understandable to every developer.</description>

      <description>Operators are a powerful tool to unlock automation and management potential in clusters. In this workshop I will first introduce and explain some core concepts of Kubernetes operators such as the controller pattern, eventual consistency, custom resources and status management in Kubernetes. The next phase in the workshop will be creating and running your first operator using the Kubebuilder SDK (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) and utilizing KIND (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) to deploy your operator locally.</description>

      <description>Running more than one containerized application in production makes teams look for solutions to quickly deploy and orchestrate containers. One of the most popular options is the open-source project Kubernetes. With the release of the Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS), engineering teams now have access to a fully managed Kubernetes control plane and time to focus on building applications. With AWS Fargate, you donâ€™t need to be an expert in Kubernetes operations to run a cost-optimized and highly-available cluster.</description>

      <title>How to provide reliable Postgres Database inside of Kubernetes Cluster with a Postgres Operator</title>
      <link>https://devops-gathering.io/workshops/reliable-postgres-operator/</link>

      <guid>https://devops-gathering.io/workshops/reliable-postgres-operator/</guid>
      <description>We will show the workings of the Zalando Postgres Operator inside of Kubernetes. We will elaborate on the do and don&amp;rsquo;t of using the Operator. Practical examples how to control Data Placement and Backup will conclude the Workshop. As a bonus we will install an graphile api generator on top of Postgres. graphile automatically generates a graphql api from an Postgres schema and provides a &amp;ldquo;nocode&amp;rdquo; backend for simple Web and Mobile applications.</description>

      <description>Enterprise projects and the resulting challenges are complex by definition. How to master such a system and realize short &amp;ldquo;time-to-market&amp;rdquo; cycles at the same time without negotiating regression errors? The answer is as easy as simple - extensive automated test suites which continuously accumulate the errors back flow. But how to setup these tests when dealing with numerous services, databases, message brokers and other infrastructure to be integrated. At this point Docker comes into the game, which enables us to run an production-near setup in the developer machine as well as in multiple staging environments.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Go</title>
      <link>https://devops-gathering.io/workshops/introduction-to-go/</link>

      <description>Go has become a popular programming language. Particularly in the DevOps space, Go has risen in popularity because Docker, Kubernetes &amp;amp; Co are written in this programming language. The strengths of Go are beside others simplicity, consistency, good support for async and parallel programming and efficiency. That makes the language a perfect match for Microservices- and DevOps-projects. This workshop is for DevOps engineers who are curious about what Go is. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to have Go experience for this workshop.</description>
