      <description>Docker is secure by default, but what about your containers? What about your docker production platforms? Are they secure too?
This workshop will help you learning how to secure your docker images and you container infrastructure. We&amp;rsquo;ll learn with hands-on labs how to use docker security features and best practices to protect your containerized services.We&amp;rsquo;ll also learn how to push , sign and verify images with Docker Content Trust and verify potential vulnerabilities in your docker images using security scanning tools.</description>

      <description>Running more than one containerized application in production makes teams look for solutions to quickly deploy and orchestrate containers. One of the most popular options is the open-source project Kubernetes. With the release of the Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS), engineering teams now have access to a fully managed Kubernetes control plane and time to focus on building applications. This workshop will deliver hands-on labs to support you getting familiar with Amazon&amp;rsquo;s EKS.</description>

      <title>Why Persistence is Hard?</title>

      <description>Requirement from practice:
Business transactions are interdependent and must be stored safely and quickly (always!) The CAP Theorem limits the ability to achieve both redundancy (partitionability) and transaction security (consistency) simultaneously.
The big cloud providers take away this difficult problem and offer endless scalability, highest security and all for a reasonable price.
 But is that really the case? Do we really need all of that? What, if you do not want to put all your business data in the hands of a cloud provider?</description>

      <title>Docker Container on Windows</title>
      <link>https://devops-gathering.io/workshops/workshop-docker-container-on-windows/</link>

      <description>Docker is a platform for running applications in lightweight units of compute called containers. You can run new and old apps in containers, and get increased portability, security and efficiency for your software. The platform supports the full development and deployment lifecycle - with Docker you can build, ship and run any app anywhere.
Docker has production support for containers since Windows Server 2016, and Windows containers don&amp;rsquo;t need separate licensing.</description>

      <title>Making Resilient, Self-Adaptive, and Autonomous Kubernetes Clusters</title>
      <link>https://devops-gathering.io/workshops/workshop-making-resilient-self-adaptive-and-autonomous-kubernetes-clusters/</link>

      <description>What do you do after you learn Kubernetes, after you deploy your applications to a production cluster, and after you fully automate continuous deployment pipeline? You work on making your cluster self-sufficient by adding monitoring, alerting, logging, and scaling.
The fact that we can run (almost) anything in Kubernetes and that it will do its best to make it fault tolerant and highly available, does not mean that our applications and clusters are bulletproof.</description>

      <title>Container as a Service at the Azure-Cloud</title>
      <link>https://devops-gathering.io/workshops/workshop-container-as-a-service-at-the-azure-cloud/</link>

      <guid>https://devops-gathering.io/workshops/workshop-container-as-a-service-at-the-azure-cloud/</guid>
      <description>Running a professional Docker cluster isn’t a trivial task. As a developer, I would like to focus on writing great apps instead of having to maintain such infrastructure. PaaS and Serverless cloud services are a solution to this problem. My job as a developer is to containerize my app while the cloud provider cares for maintaining, scaling, and securing the underlying base services. In this session, long-time Azure MVP and Regional Director Rainer Stropek introduces you to Container-as-a-Service in the Microsoft Azure cloud.</description>

      <title>Kubernetes Advanced</title>
      <link>https://devops-gathering.io/workshops/workshop-kubernetes-advanced/</link>

      <description>Kubernetes provides a set of more then thirty resource types out of the box and that alone might look overwhelming for a beginner. Still these gain new features with each release and with the popularity of the operator pattern, more and more custom resources show up in our Kubernetes clusters.
In this workshop we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on some more advanced topics, explain their background and how to use them to get a better overview and more confidence in the stability of a more complex Kubernetes setup.</description>

      <title>New Work Academy: agile working – an interactive introduction</title>
      <link>https://devops-gathering.io/workshops/workshop-new-work-academy-agile-working-an-interactive-introduction/</link>

      <description>We are going to explore what agile working really means and for which problems it has come out to be the best practice in solving them. So, there is going to be a little bit of an explanation about the circumstances which led to the agile manifest and also why agile methods are not a method to believe in and to simply put in place but a framework of change, comprised of values and principles which have simply turned out to be the most helpful ones.</description>
