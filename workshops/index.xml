      <description>Running a professional Docker cluster isnâ€™t a trivial task. As a developer, I would like to focus on writing great apps instead of having to maintain such infrastructure. PaaS and Serverless cloud services are a solution to this problem. My job as a developer is to containerize my app while the cloud provider cares for maintaining, scaling, and securing the underlying base services. In this session, long-time Azure MVP and Regional Director Rainer Stropek introduces you to Container-as-a-Service in the Microsoft Azure cloud.</description>

      <description>What do you do after you learn Kubernetes, after you deploy your applications to a production cluster, and after you fully automate continuous deployment pipeline? You work on making your cluster self-sufficient by adding monitoring, alerting, logging, and scaling.
The fact that we can run (almost) anything in Kubernetes and that it will do its best to make it fault tolerant and highly available, does not mean that our applications and clusters are bulletproof.</description>

      <description>Running more than one containerized application in production makes teams look for solutions to quickly deploy and orchestrate containers. One of the most popular options is the open-source project Kubernetes. With the release of the Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS), engineering teams now have access to a fully managed Kubernetes control plane and time to focus on building applications. This workshop will deliver hands-on labs to support you getting familiar with Amazon&amp;rsquo;s EKS.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes provides a set of more then thirty resource types out of the box and that alone might look overwhelming for a beginner. Still these gain new features with each release and with the popularity of the operator pattern, more and more custom resources show up in our Kubernetes clusters.
In this workshop we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on some more advanced topics, explain their background and how to use them to get a better overview and more confidence in the stability of a more complex Kubernetes setup.</description>
