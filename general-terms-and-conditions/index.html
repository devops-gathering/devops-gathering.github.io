<p>By signing up for a bee42 solutions GmbH conference and workshop, the following terms and conditions will be agreed upon.</p>

<p>Please read these conditions carefully!</p>

<h2 id="scope-of-application">SCOPE OF APPLICATION</h2>

<p>The organizer of the conference and workshops is</p>

<p>bee42 solutions GmbH, Am Josephsschacht 72 D-44879 Bochum, Germany (further on in this document: bee42).</p>

<p>For the participation in a bee42 workshop or conference, the following “general conditions for bee42 conferences and workshops” apply, which govern the contractual basis between bee42 and a participant.</p>

<p>The valid version of these conditions applies at the time of registration. The German version shall have priority in the event of an objection or other deviations as well as in disputes over the interpretation of this contract.</p>

<p>bee42 does not accept any formulations which differ from the “General Conditions for bee42 Conferences and Workshops”.</p>

<p>bee42 trainings and bee42 workshops are aimed at entrepreneurs. In the event that a consumer signs up for a bee42 conference and bee42 workshop according to the consumer protection law, the following right of revocation applies to consumers according to the consumer protection law in addition to the “General conditions for bee42 conferences and workshops”.</p>

<h2 id="right-of-withdrawal-for-consumers-according-to-consumer-protection-law">RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL FOR CONSUMERS ACCORDING TO CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW</h2>

<p>If you are a consumer under the Consumer Protection Act, you have the following right of withdrawal in addition to the “General Conditions for bee42 Conferences and Workshops”</p>

<p>Right of withdrawal instruction</p>

<p><strong>a. Right of withdrawal</strong></p>

<p><strong>You may revoke your declaration of the contract in writing (eg letter or e-mail) within 30 days after receipt of a confirmation of registration by bee42 without giving reasons. The punctual sending of the revocation is sufficient for the revocation period. The revocation must be sent to:</strong></p>

<p><strong>bee42 solutions GmbH At the Josephsschacht 44879 Bochum, Germany</strong></p>

<p><strong>E-mail: info@bee42.com</strong></p>

<p><strong>b. Withdrawal sequence</strong></p>

<p><strong>In the case of an effective revocation, the services received at both ends must be returned and any benefits (eg interest) drawn. If you are unable to return the received performance in whole or in part or in a deteriorated condition, you may have to provide us with a decree. This may mean that you must nevertheless fulfill the contractual payment obligations for the period up to the cancellation. Obligations to reimburse payments must be fulfilled within 30 days. The period begins for you with the sending of your declaration of revocation, for us with their receipt.</strong></p>

<p><strong>c. Special instructions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Your right of revocation expires prematurely if the contract is completely fulfilled by both parties at your express request before you have exercised your right of revocation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>End of right of withdrawal instruction</strong></p>
