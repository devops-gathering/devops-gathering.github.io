<p>By signing up for a communicode AG conference and workshop, the following terms and conditions will be agreed upon.</p>

<p>Please read these conditions carefully!</p>

<h2 id="scope-of-application">SCOPE OF APPLICATION</h2>

<p>The organizer of the conference and workshops is</p>

<p>communicode AG (further on in this document: communicode).</p>

<p>For the participation in a communicode workshop or conference, the following “general conditions for communicode conferences and workshops” apply, which govern the contractual basis between communicode and a participant.</p>

<p>The valid version of these conditions applies at the time of registration. The German version shall have priority in the event of an objection or other deviations as well as in disputes over the interpretation of this contract.</p>

<p>communicode does not accept any formulations which differ from the “General Conditions for communicode Conferences and Workshops”.</p>

<p>communicode trainings and communicode workshops are aimed at entrepreneurs. In the event that a consumer signs up for a communicode conference and communicode workshop according to the consumer protection law, the following right of revocation applies to consumers according to the consumer protection law in addition to the “General conditions for communicode conferences and workshops”.</p>

<h2 id="right-of-withdrawal-for-consumers-according-to-consumer-protection-law">RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL FOR CONSUMERS ACCORDING TO CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW</h2>

<p>If you are a consumer under the Consumer Protection Act, you have the following right of withdrawal in addition to the “General Conditions for communicode Conferences and Workshops”</p>

<p>Right of withdrawal instruction</p>

<p><strong>a. Right of withdrawal</strong></p>

<p><strong>You may revoke your declaration of the contract in writing (eg letter or e-mail) within 30 days after receipt of a confirmation of registration by communicode without giving reasons. The punctual sending of the revocation is sufficient for the revocation period. The revocation must be sent to:</strong></p>

<p><strong>communicode AG Rellinghauser Straße 332, 45136 Essen</strong></p>

<p><strong>e-mail: info@communicode.de</strong></p>

<p><strong>b. Withdrawal sequence</strong></p>

<p><strong>In the case of an effective revocation, the services received at both ends must be returned and any benefits (eg interest) drawn. If you are unable to return the received performance in whole or in part or in a deteriorated condition, you may have to provide us with a decree. This may mean that you must nevertheless fulfill the contractual payment obligations for the period up to the cancellation. Obligations to reimburse payments must be fulfilled within 30 days. The period begins for you with the sending of your declaration of revocation, for us with their receipt.</strong></p>

<p><strong>c. Special instructions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Your right of revocation expires prematurely if the contract is completely fulfilled by both parties at your express request before you have exercised your right of revocation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>End of right of withdrawal instruction</strong></p>

<h2 id="prices">PRICES</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise specified in detail, a price quote for a communicode conference or a communicode workshop is provided as a net price.

Registration for a communicode-conference or a communicode workshop can be made by e-mail or via the internet form. After receipt of an application, this is confirmed by communicode in writing. A participant will receive his invoice within 10 days of his registration.</p>

<p>b.
A participant can revoke his registration before the beginning of a communicode event. In the case of cancellation or cancellation of the registration no additional fees will be levied, if cancellation or cancellation takes place no later than 14 days after the invoice date indicated on the invoice. In the case of cancellation or cancellation of the registration after the said 14 days, the participant must pay 50% of the gross price if cancellation or cancellation takes place no later than 30 days before the start of the event. In the case of a later cancellation or in the event of non-attendance, the participant will be charged the full gross price for participation.</p>

<p>c.
The cancellation is subject to the text form. Proof of sending the cancellation is the responsibility of the vendor.</p>

<h2 id="due-date-and-payment">DUE DATE AND PAYMENT</h2>
