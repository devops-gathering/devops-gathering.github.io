We collect personal information from you (e.g. name, address, email address, telephone number, etc.) in accordance with the provisions of German data protection statutes. Information is considered personal if it can be associated exclusively to a specific natural person.

<p>Please be aware that data transfer via the internet is subject to security risks and, therefore, complete protection against third-party access to transferred data cannot be ensured.</p>

<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>

<p>Our website makes use of so-called cookies in order to recognize repeat use of our website by the same user/internet connection subscriber. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser downloads and stores on your computer. They are used to improve our website and services. In most cases these are so-called &ldquo;session cookies&rdquo; that are deleted once you leave our website.</p>

<p>To an extent, however, these cookies also pass along information used to automatically recognize you. Recognition occurs through an IP address saved to the cookies. The information thereby obtained is used to improve our services and to expedite your access to the website.</p>

<p>You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website.</p>

<h2 id="newsletter">Newsletter</h2>

<p>Our website offers you the opportunity to subscribe to our newsletter. The newsletter provides you periodically with information about our services. To receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address. We will review the email address you provide for the purpose of determining whether you are in fact the owner of the email address provided or whether the actual owner of said address is authorized to receive the newsletter. When subscribing to our newsletter, we will store your IP address as well as the date and time you subscribed. This serves to protect us in the event a third party improperly and without your knowledge makes use of your email address to subscribe to our newsletter. We will not collect any other data. The data thereby collected is used solely for the purpose of receiving our newsletter. No data is transferred to third parties. Nor is any of this information matched to any information that other components of our website may collect. You may cancel your subscription to the newsletter at any time. You will find additional details in the email confirming your subscription as well as in each newsletter.</p>

<h2 id="use-of-google-analytics">Use of Google Analytics</h2>

<p>Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter referred to as “Google“. Google Analytics employs so-called “cookies“, text files that are stored to your computer in order to facilitate an analysis of your use of the site. The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our site, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google’s location in the US and stored there. In using Google Analytics our website employs the extension, &ldquo;_gat._anonymizeIp&rdquo;. In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your IP address before transferring it from member states of the European Union or signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Google uses this information to analyze your use of our site, to compile reports for us on internet activity and to provide other services relating to website and internet use. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law or where such third parties process this data on Google’s behalf.  Google states that it will in never associate your IP address with other data held by Google. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website. Furthermore, Google offers a deactivation add-on for most current browsers that provides you with more control over what data Google can collect on websites you access. The add-on tells the JavaScript (ga.js) used by Google Analytics not to transmit any information about website visits to Google Analytics. However, the browser deactivation add-on offered by Google Analytics does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analysis services we may engage. You can find additional information on how to install the browser add-on at the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>.</p>

<h2 id="use-of-twitter">Use of Twitter</h2>

<p>Our website employs components provided by Twitter. Twitter is a service of Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.</p>

<p>Each time our website receives an access request equipped with a Twitter component, the component prompts your browser to download an image of this component from Twitter. Through this process, Twitter is informed precisely which page of our website is being visited. We have no control over the data that Twitter collects in the process, or over the extent of the data that Twitter collects. To the best of our knowledge, Twitter collects the URL of each website accessed as well as the IP address of the user, but does so solely for the purpose of displaying Twitter components. Additional information may be obtained from the Twitter data privacy policy, at: <a href="http://twitter.com/privacy">http://twitter.com/privacy</a>.
You may change your data privacy settings in your account settings, at <a href="http://twitter.com/account/settings">http://twitter.com/account/settings</a>.</p>

<h2 id="use-of-youtube">Use of YouTube</h2>

<p>On our website we use components (videos) of YouTube, LLC 901 Cherry Ave., 94066 San Bruno, CA, USA, a company belonging to Google Inc., Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>

<p>To this end, we use the “ - enhanced data protection mode - ” option provided by YouTube.</p>

<p>When you display a page that has an embedded video, a connection will be made to the YouTube server and the content will appear on the website via a communication to your browser.</p>

<p>According to the information provided by YouTube, in “ - enhanced data protection mode -”, data is only transferred to the YouTube server, in particular which of our websites you have visited, if you watch the video. If you are logged onto YouTube at the same time, this information will be matched to your YouTube member account. You can prevent this from happening by logging out of your member account before visiting our website.</p>

<p>Further information about data protection by YouTube is provided by Google under the following link: <a href="https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/</a></p>

<h2 id="use-of-mailchimp">Use of MailChimp</h2>

<p><strong>Newsletter Consent</strong></p>

<p>You will be asked to consent to the use of your personal data to receive our newsletter as follows:</p>

<p>“I have read the privacy policy and I give my consent to data being processed by a service provider located in the United States”.</p>

<p>We use the newsletter to provide you with regular updates about our offers. To receive our newsletter, you will need a valid email address. We will then check the email address entered to ensure that you are actually its owner or if its owner has agreed to receive our newsletter. By registering for the newsletter, we will save your IP address and date and time of registration. This will be used in case a third party misuses your email address to subscribe to our newsletter without your knowledge.</p>

<p>We will not compare the data collected during newsletter registration with any other data that might be collected by other components of our site.</p>

<p><strong>Newsletter by MailChimp</strong></p>

<p>We use MailChimp to send our newsletter to our subscribers. MailChimp is a service provided by The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 512 Means Street, Suite 404, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA.</p>

<p>The data stored when you registered for the newsletter (email address, name, IP address, and time and date of registration) will be sent to a server operated by The Rocket Science Group in the United States and stored there in accordance with its Safe Harbour Agreement.</p>

<p>Further information about the data protection offered by MailChimp can be found at: <a href="http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/">http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/</a>.</p>

<p>You may cancel your newsletter subscription and revoke your consent to the storage of this data at any time with future effect. For instructions to take this step, please refer to the confirmation email and each newsletter.</p>

<p><strong>Newsletter tracking</strong></p>

<p>Our newsletter includes so-called web bugs that allow us to recognise if and when an email has been opened and which links in the email have been clicked by its recipient.</p>

<p>This data is stored by us so that we can best align our newsletter to the wishes and interests of our subscribers. Accordingly, the data thus collected is used to send personalised newsletters to each recipient. </p>

<p>You will be asked to consent to the use of your personal data as follows:</p>

<p>“I agree that my data and my user responses will be stored electronically by newsletter tracking so that I can receive a personalised newsletter. The revocation of the consent to receive the newsletter constitutes a revocation of the consent for the tracking described above.”</p>

<p>By revoking the consent to receive the newsletter, the consent to the aforementioned tracking is revoked.</p>

<h2 id="the-use-of-google-remarketing">The use of Google Remarketing</h2>

<p>On our website, we promote the service Google Remarketing belonging to the company Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter &ldquo;Google&rdquo;. Advertisements may appear for users who have already visited our website in the past with Google Remarketing. Within the Google network, advertisements adapted to your interests can hereby be displayed on our site. Google Remarketing uses cookies for this evaluation. Cookies are small text files stored on your computer which allow the use of the website to be analyzed. This makes it possible to recognize our visitors if these sites are accessed within the advertising network of Google. In this way, advertisements can be presented within the advertising network of Google based on content which has previously been accessed on websites within the Google advertising network by visitors who are also using the Google Remarketing feature. Google does not itself collect any personal data. You can disable this feature by making the appropriate settings under <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads">http://www.google.com/settings/ads</a>.</p>

<h2 id="use-of-google-adwords">Use of Google-Adwords</h2>

<p>For purposes of promotion, our website also employs the Google ad tool &ldquo;Google-Adwords&rdquo;. As part of this, our website employs the analysis service &ldquo;Conversion-Tracking&rdquo; from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter referred to as “Google“. If you access our site by way of a Google ad, a cookie is placed on your computer. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser downloads and stores to your computer. These so-called &ldquo;conversion cookies&rdquo; cease to be active after 30 days and are not used to identify you personally. If you visit certain pages of our website while the cookie is still active, we and Google know that you, as user, have clicked on ads placed on Google and were redirected to our site. Google uses the information obtained through &ldquo;conversion cookies&rdquo; to compile statistics for our website. These statistics tell us the total number of users who have clicked on our ad as well as which pages of our site were then accessed by each user. However, neither we nor other advertisers who use &ldquo;Google-Adwords&rdquo; receive any kind of information that can be used to personally identify users. You can prevent the installation of &ldquo;conversion cookies&rdquo; by making the appropriate change to your browser settings, for example by setting your browser so that the automatic placement of cookies is deactivated or by blocking cookies from the domain &ldquo;googleadservices.com“.</p>

<p>You can obtain the relevant data privacy policy from Google at the following link:

<p>On the basis of the Federal Data Protection Act, you may contact us at no cost if you have questions relating to the collection, processing or use of your personal information, if you wish to request the correction, blocking or deletion of the same, or if you wish to cancel explicitly granted consent. Please note that you have the right to have incorrect data corrected or to have personal data deleted, where such claim is not barred by any legal obligation to retain this data.</p>
