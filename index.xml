      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this keynote we will examine the drivers and goals behind DevOps, why we need the change, how DevOps affects the whole IT value chain and what else is needed to really &amp;ldquo;become DevOps&amp;rdquo;. We will develop a DevOps ecosystem and draw the missing lines between several important concepts that all feed into the goals behind DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using containers to develop, test and run applications is well known for cloud and datacenter environments. Since last year Docker is also officially available for a wide range of ARM devices. In this hands-on workshop we&amp;rsquo;re going to introduce you to the principles and specific requirements of using Docker on a low-cost ARM cluster. Step by step we&amp;rsquo;re looking into the details on how to install Docker in no time and run your first microservice application with Docker Compose. Later on we&amp;rsquo;re digging even deeper into the specific requirements for containerized IoT applications to build resource constraint containers and optimizing containers for minimal size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker can run and orchestrate your applications very efficiently, even on the smallest devices. Step into a new dimension when using Docker on low-powered ARM devices which breaks all limits and discover and resolve bottlenecks easily before they hit you in production. Scale down to the bare minimum, speed it up and get ready for a truly massive scale. Let’s start using Docker in your complete software stack to interconnect the Cloud and the future with Billions of IoT devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this hands-on workshop we’re going to introduce you to the basic principles of Docker and how the orchestration of container works, even if you have to handle a power or network outage. We&amp;rsquo;ll install Docker on real baremetal hardware sitting on your desk as a multi-node Raspberry Pi cluster. Then deploying a first distributed application and scale it up to a fault-tolerant system and testing it in a chaos monkey fashion with real failures of the compute nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally we&amp;rsquo;ll dig deeper into the specific requirements of using containers for IoT use cases. By iterating through optimization steps for small devices, you will discover which value it even brings to classic container applications. This reveals the details and benefits of a container-based development and runtime environment, which helps to achieve better portability, maintenance and security by isolating the application code from the hardware. We&amp;rsquo;ll try to inspire you to learn and use Docker and containers on ARM devices in a very practical way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to orchestrate containers with Docker on low-cost bare metal hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the basic concepts of Docker and building fault-tolerant services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn building resource constraint containers and optimizing containers for minimal size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-you-will-need&#34;&gt;What you will need&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic Docker experience recommended, but not required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring your own laptop (Windows, macOS, Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need a SSH client or Putty to access the ARM cluster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Automated container building with GitLab/CI</title>
      <link>https://devops-gathering.io/workshops/Automated-container-builds-with-gitlab-ci/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Whether small startups or large companies - many of them rely on the open-source Docker technology. But what about the kind of containers that roll up the virtualization market and change the software development in the long term? Docker promises a quick start, flexible configuration and stable images for development and production. Nice, but a developer or operator must be present in order to setup automation, to build, test and deliver Docker images. At this workshop you learn how to setup GitLab/CI with the objective to maintain your project sources, automate your Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline for simple Docker images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start with an overview and introduce the first steps by demonstrating the usage of GitLab/CI. You will get an overview of the most important components, instructions and concepts. Using a simple example, you will learn how to implement a microservice, automate the build with a simple gitlab runner, install with Docker, test and integrate with other services in an environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to setup GitLab/CI in a simple way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the basic concepts of build docker images with GitLab/CI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to setup a simple microservice test pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-you-will-need&#34;&gt;What you will need&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic Docker experience recommended&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring your own laptop (Windows, macOS, Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need a SSH client or Putty to access the cloud instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
